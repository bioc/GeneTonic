\title{A sample output from fgsea}
\description{
A sample output object as created from a call to the \code{fgsea()} function, in
the \code{fgsea} package, as a practical framework for performing GSEA
}
\details{
This object has been created on the data from the \code{macrophage} package
by analyzing downstream the differentially expressed genes
when comparing IFNg treated samples vs naive samples, accounting
for the different cell lines included.
